# hobarthackerspace.github.io
A GitHub Docs space for the Hackerspace

This repository serves as the source for the HHS public web site: <https://hobarthackerspace.org.au/>

The site is built with Jekyll, using the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

To add a page to the site, put the appropriate markdown document in the "_pages" directory, 
with suitable "front matter" (use an existing page for a model for new front matter). See [the minimal-mistakes guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/pages/) for more details.

To keep things maintainable with a number of us maintaining the site, keep the "_pages" directory and filenames structured
to mirror the site structure. (So, if the URL your page is "/example/content/", call the page file "content.md" 
and place it in the directory "_page/example/", creating that directory if necessary.)
