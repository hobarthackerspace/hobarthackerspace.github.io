## About us

Hobart Hackerspace Inc. was founded in 2012 after a successful crowd
funding campaign which was designed to not only raise money, but to also
gauge the interest in opening a dedicated community workshop dedicated
to technology and art. After many months of searching, a license was
signed with the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services to
utilise one of the guardhouses at 2 St Johns Ave, New Town, on the edge
of the former St Johns Park orphanage.

We are still in this building, though quickly outgrowing it so have
begun the search for a new home, hopefully with higher ceilings and more
open spaces.

Visitors are welcome on Thursday nights from 7pm, however, you will be
asked to join after a few visits as we are currently funded entirely
through membership fees.

For more information, please contact us at
committee@hobarthackerspace.org.au for quickest response to contact
members of the management committee.
