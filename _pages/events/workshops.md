A core objective of Hobart Hackerspace Inc. is to promote technical
innovation in the wider community, as such we sometimes run workshops
and public events. We can also arrange special demonstrations and
instruction for students of all ages and skill levels.

Here are a sample of some of the workshops that have been run in the
past, and may run again in the future. We are always interested in
hearing your ideas for workshop topics. Especially if you are able to
teach one for us! 

**Squishy Circuits -- Beginner**\
A conductive and non-conductive play-doh is used in place of wires to
give children and the young at heart a hands on and fun way of making
basic circuits. Connect a power source and watch lights flicker and
motors turn. Play with different electrodes to turn the doh in to a
battery and inadvertently learn some new things about analogue
electronics in the process.

**Coder Dojo -- Beginner**\
CoderDojo is a volunteer led, global movement oriented around running
free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people
aged 7-17, specializing in computer programming, technology and
electronics. CoderDojo @ Hobart Hackerspace emphasises self motivated
learning through fun projects, peer to peer mentoring and creativity.
Young people learn from one another about computers, programming, tools
and the maker movement. More information available
from [http://coderdojo.com](http://coderdojo.com/)

**Introduction to Electronics -- Beginner**\
Taught by three of our most experienced members, this course covers all
the basics of electronics. Calculating voltages and currents, Ohms law,
what different components do and how they function. By the end of this
workshop series you should be able to comfortably design and build a
simple circuit, and have the basic skills to troubleshoot faulty
equipment.

**Arduino -- Moderate**\
The current "must have" in the electronics experimenters world is an
Arduino. These little AT family micro-controller development boards are
a stepping stone towards hardware development and digital electronics.
We also have a few ARM development boards in the form of mBeds and other
even more basic boards, so you can work your way up to designing and
building your own computer based controllers

**PIC -- Moderate to Advanced**\
Our PIC workshop is the entry point for people who want to learn about
board design. It is assumed participants know a little about electronics
and programming so our PIC workshop looks at designing a circuit,
drawing it up using PCB design software, isolation routing the board
using the 3-axis Mill, soldering components and then programming it to
do what you designed it to do. We can do a more introductory version
where the circuit has been designed for you so you can get to the fun
parts quicker or we can work with you to design something to suit your
own needs.

**3D CAD -- Beginner**\
Using FreeCAD Primitives and Boolean Operations (Don't worry, we'll
explain this), you can learn enough to be able to design simple 3D
Objects and prepare them for the CNC Mill or 3D printer. Once you have
got these basics covered, you'll be surprised how easy it is.

**CNC Mill -- Moderate**\
Probably our most complicated peice of equipment is the CNC Mill. To
operate this you need to understand the principles of how the tools cut,
how to calculate speeds, how to prepare toolpaths in CAM (using CamBam)
and how to set up and operate the mill itself. This is a workshop series
of 4 evenings offered regularly.

**Other Workshops**\
Our members have a huge range of skills and are all too willing to share
what they know. We regularly host workshops on other topics such as the
operation and maintenance of machinery, to electronic art, virtual
reality and gaming, and other fun things people dream up along the way.
