Here's a reference to what's on when and where, so you can plan ahead.

The space can get pretty busy at times, but we can handle several activities at once, so long as they don't get in one another's way. Listed below are two calendars - **Events** and **Resources**. 

If an activity involves a group of us, whether or not it's at the Space, we put it in the *Events* calendar.

If an activity at the Space will need exclusive use of a room or a major tool, we put it in the *Resources* calendar.

### Stop Press: Christmas BBQ Thursday 18<sup>Th</sup> December at 6:00pm at the Space!
