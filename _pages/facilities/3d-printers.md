### Safety Warnings

**Advice: **The printing process is slow, and as it is our policy to
never leave machinery operating unsupervised, be sure you bring a cut
lunch and a book if you're printing out a large or complicated item.

**Warning:** The extrusion heads and build platform are hot, do not
attempt to reach in to the machine while it is printing and ensure all
safety covers are in place before you start.

**Warning:** The stepper motors are stronger than they look, do not
attempt to put your hands inside the machine while it is moving.

### User Information

We are still working on a user guide specific to our hackerspace, in the
mean time information about this machine can be found on the makerbot
website:

<http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2012/03/13/the-makerbot-replicator-user-guide/>

We do have some other, older ones that are not fully functional:

-   Cupcake -- a small printer that Mark P has kindly rebuilt. Needs a
    PC building to drive it, and a better home in the space!
-   The Prusa -- a larger printer donated to us by Michael R. It
    currently lives in the electronics room. Apparently it works, but we
    need to build a PC to drive it.
-   MakerBot Replicator -- Our first 3D printer, it's now both out of date and somewhat sick.
