# CNC Router (Flat Bed)

This machine is a beauty!  A simple workhorse with a powerful three
phase spindle motor, this machine is as happy cutting SMD circuit boards
as it is cutting boxes out of aluminium.  With software to drive this
under Linux or Windows, it is quite easy to learn how to operate.

GCode for this machine can be generated from CAD systems, PCB Design
software and from vector paths in Inkscape.

### Safety Information

-   Hearing Protection must be worn while operating this machine
-   Eye Protection must be worn while operating this machine
-   Do not even think about trying to put your hand in this machine
    while it is operating, the fast moving axes and powerful spindle are
    really going to make light work of your hand or other body parts.

### User Information

machine.
