One of our members, Bob Elliot, runs a Robot Club on Friday afternoons
for school-age children in Hobart.

Bob makes regular use of the CNC mill to cut out each wooden chassis:

He is often here during open night too (Thursday evenings), so please
ask for him by name, if you want to learn more about the club.

Access to Friday's session is by gold coin donation but we also now
have a student membership open to all students up to grade 12.Â  This is
$5 per month and allows access to all Robot Clubs, workshops or general
gatherings at the space.
