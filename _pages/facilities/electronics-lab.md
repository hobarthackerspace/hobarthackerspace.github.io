Our electronics workbench is complete with soldering, desoldering, power
supply and oscilloscopes, along with hand tools and a large collection
of spare parts.

If your interest is in making PCBs then we can help you with isolation
routing on the mill, or chemical etching of your own boards.

We also have a collection of microcontroller dev boards including a
classroom set of Arduino's which can be used to learn about the
wonderful world of digital electronics.
