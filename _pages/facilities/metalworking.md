We have a small collection of metalworking tools, including:
- Plasma cutter & MIG welder
  - Including the appropriate protective clothing
- Jeweller's lathe
- Grinding & surfacing tools
- Drill press

Several of our members have small casting furnaces, which get brought 
along to use in the yard where it's safe to fire them up.
