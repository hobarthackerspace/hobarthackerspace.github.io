# Laser Cutter/Engraver

Our laser cutter is a <a href="https://flux3dp.com/beambox/" target="_blank">Beambox</a> 
laser capable of cutting perspex, glass, wood and MDF, as well as etching and engraving on many surfaces. 

It has a bed size of 400 x 375 mm and a cutting thickness of 0 - 10 mm (varies by material)​

The software driving it (<a href="https://flux3dp.com/beam-studio/" target="_blank">Beam Studio</a>) works from images in many formats (SVG / PNG / JPG / DXF / PDF / AI), with different
layers representing different laser power settings and feed rates. These can be vector or raster images.
