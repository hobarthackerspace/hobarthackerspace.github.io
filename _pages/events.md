Many Hackerspace members enjoy working quietly in the Space when there\'s no-one else around,
but in addition, we involve ourselves in many events, both in the Space and as part of bigger public events.

## Calendar of Events

## Within the Space
### Open Nights
We have an [Open Night](/events/open-night/) every Thursday from 7pm until late.  This is a
perfect opportunity to come along to the space and meet the members,
work on projects, learn some robotics or just have a general chat.

### Project Nights
Every Tuesday evening is a members-only [Projects Night](/events/projects-night/).
This is an opportunity for members to work on their own projects while others
are around, giving a chance to ask for help or share what we're doing.

### We run specialised [workshops](/events/workshops/) at random intervals for both members and guests.
Keep an eye on our [members-only Facebook group](https://hobarthackerspace.us21.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8a37739687e69ea2baaeb62e1&id=5a26478467&e=bca8dbc60d)

## Public Events
### Festival of Bright Ideas
  - Hobart has an annual science-based event called the <a href="https://festivalofbrightideas.com.au/"
   target="_blank">Festival of Bright Ideas</a> (FOBI). It\'s focussed on kids finding the joys of
   Science & Technology and is run as part of National Science Week each year.
   Hobart  Hackerspace has been a regular participant for a number of years now and were there again in 2023. Photos below show some of the fun!

   And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AI1Ly1uvecw"  target="_blank">here's a video</a> of some of the activities, thanks to Gryff.

### EdCAT 2024 display at TasTAFE
- As part of the EdCAT 2024 summit held at TasTAFE on April 18, Hobart
Hackerspace contributed to a display of historical computing in the
TAFE library.
A number of hackers from the space lent items from their own
collections for display curated by Muria, who is an HHS member and a staff
member at TasTAFE.

- In the picture, there are a number of items visible. 
  - circuit boards, one using discrete components (circa 1962), and one using  TTL chips (circa 1972). 
  - a length of Jacquard loom punch cards &mdash; the earliest form of punched card/paper information storage 
  - a length of paper tape &mdash; information storage used by the kinds of computers that were built using the circuit boards shown
  - a magnetic core memory unit, with the cores visible for very keen-eyed visitors.
  - a stack of disk storage platters from the 1970's, storing about 80MB (1/100<sup>th</sup> of a small USB stick)
  - several personal computers dating from 1980's to current times.
  - the large panel to the left of the display cabinet is an analog
    computer of the kind that was previously used for engineering design.

- Thank you, Muria,  for your skills to curate this display, 
  and thanks to Tom, Brian and Michael for providing interesting items to show.



### Bruny Island Science Day
  - <a href = "https://inspiringtas.org.au/event/bruny-island-fun-day/"  target="_blank">Bruny Island Science Fun Day</a> is a public event held annually at the <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/brunyquarantinestation/"  target="_blank">Bruny Island Quarantine Station</a>. It's a day for kids and families to explore the fun to be had in science, while exploring the old quarantine site on Tasmania\'s Bruny Island.

    Members of the Space attended for the first time in 2023, and both they and the families that came along enjoyed themselves immensely.

### Lift Off
  - Run by the <a href="https://www.tmag.tas.gov.au/"  target="_blank">Tasmanian Museum & Art Gallery (TMAG)</a> during October school holidays, <a href="https://www.tmag.tas.gov.au/learning_and_discovery/about_learning_and_discovery/childrens_festival"  target="_blank">Lift Off</a> is "Tasmania’s only dedicated annual cultural festival for children and young people". It's a broad-spectrum arts/cultural/science/tech event allowing "young people and children to explore new ideas and experiences through hands-on activities and inspiring presentations".

    The images below are of a Lift Off activity where kids were able to do things from learning soldering and racing robots to engraving life images on transparent perspex and showing them with side light.

### Beaker Street
  - A Tasmanian winter Arts and Science event is <a href="https://beakerstreet.com.au/"  target="_blank">Beaker Street</a>. Also part of National Science Week, it has more of an Arts and Community focus than FOBI and includes activities for all ages and activities outside Hobart. Hobart Hackerspace has participated in a number of Beaker Street events, including running workshops.

    The images below are of a Beaker Street workshop where participnts built an electronic microscope and captured some delightful images.
