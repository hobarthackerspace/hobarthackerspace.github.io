Many HackerSpace members enjoy working quietly in the Space when there\'s no-one else around, 
but in addition, we involve ourselves in many events, both in the Space and as part of bigger public events. 

## Within the Space
- We have an [Open Night](/events/open-night/) each week, which usually becomes a social event where like-minded folks chat on an amazing range of topics.
- We run [workshops](/events/workshops/) for both members and guests.

## Public Events
- Festival of Bright Ideas
  - Hobart has an annual science-based event called the <a href="https://festivalofbrightideas.com.au/"  target="_blank">Festival of Bright Ideas</a> (FOBI). It\'s focussed on kids finding the joys of Science & Technology and is run as part of National Science Week each year. Hobart  Hackerspace has been a regular participant for a number of years now.

- Beaker Street
  - A Tasmanian winter Arts and Science event is <a href="https://beakerstreet.com.au/"  target="_blank">Beaker Street</a>. Also part of National Science Week, it has more of an Arts and Community focus than FOBI and includes activities for all ages and activities outside Hobart. Hobart Hackerspace has participated in a number of Beaker Street events, including running workshops.
