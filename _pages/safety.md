## Be safe in the Space
The safety of our members and the public is very important to us.Â  We
provide instruction on the use of all equipment, along with appropriate
safety equipment. It is the responsibility of all members to ensure that
all equipment and work practices in the Hackerspace are safe.

## Some basic rules:

-   You must wear any personal protective equipment listed in the safe
    working manual for each piece of equipment
-   You must ensure you have been trained and are competent on the safe
    use of any equipment you wish to use
-   No one is to work on any mains voltage equipment unless you are
    appropriately licensed to do so
-   Encourage those around you to work safely, and report any problems
    you see
-   Tag and report any faulty equipment
-   No machinery is to be left running unsupervised
-   When working on exposed electrical circuitry carrying mains or higher 
    voltages there must be someone else  present in the Space.

Please report any incidences or concerns about safety using the contact
form on this website
