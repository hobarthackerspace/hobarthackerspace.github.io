## About us

From Wikipedia:

> A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace, or
> hackspace) is a community-operated workspace where people with common
> interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital art or
> electronic art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.

Hobart Hackerspace Inc. was founded in 2012 after a successful crowd
funding campaign which was designed to not only raise money, but to also
gauge the interest in opening a dedicated community workshop dedicated
to technology and art. After many months of searching, a license was
signed with the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services to
utilise one of the heritage guardhouses at 2 St Johns Ave, New Town.

Visitors are welcome on Thursday nights from 7pm, however, you will be
asked to join after a few visits as we rely on membership fees for a 
significant portion of our funding.

### Governance

The Hobart Hackerspace is a [registered Tasmanian not-for-profit association](https://www.cbos.tas.gov.au/topics/clubs-fundraising/incorporated-associations) (Reg no IA12014).

Our activities are governed by our [Articles of Association (Constitution)](/assets/documents/Constitution-2019-as-approved.pdf/). Although we are fundamentally a loose co-operative group, we have a Committee to make formal decisions.
