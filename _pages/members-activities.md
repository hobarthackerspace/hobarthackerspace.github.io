# Projects and Stuff
Hobart Hackerspace members are a diverse lot and the diversity of their projects, activities and creations reflect this.
The pictures and links on this page show some of the things we do or have done.

In no particular order:

## Steam power
STEAM is a 21st century acronym for *Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics*. 
In the previous two centuries it referred to the harnessing of the power of water vapour to produce mechanical energy.
One of our members has a few model steam engines, which he has brought in to show in the space. They are a popular display, giving a different view of technology, and what can be built.
We have run several of them and explored their working principles. [See more here](/members-activities/ken-steam-engines/).
