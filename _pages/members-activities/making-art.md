Several past & current members make art. Sometimes these end up at the hackerspace on semi-permanent
loan! We have had an exhibition at the space a while ago, that took some organising. We also get occasional enquiries from artists needing a help with electronics & lighting things up. As usual, we are happy to help.

Some tools like the laser cutter and welder are very useful to make art, as these are expensive tools to own.

Also donations to the space have been very useful as a source of materials for art, such as old computers and vintage electronic components.
